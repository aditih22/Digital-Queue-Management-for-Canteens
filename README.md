# 🍴 Digital Queue Management for Canteens
*A UI/UX Case Study*

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Long, chaotic queues at canteens waste time and frustrate students & staff.  
This project explores a **digital queue management system** that provides:  
- Virtual token generation  
- Real-time wait-time updates  
- Notifications when food is ready  
- Group ordering features  

The goal: **reduce waiting time, improve user experience, and bring order to the canteen system.**

---

## 🎯 UX Research  

### Problem Statement  
Current canteen systems rely on physical queues → time-consuming, inefficient, stressful.  

### Target Users  
- **Students** (who want quick meals between classes)  
- **Staff/Faculty** (with limited lunch breaks)  
- **Canteen Owners** (who want smoother operations)  

### User Personas  
See [`research/user-personas.md`](research/user-personas.md)  

### User Journey  
See [`research/user-journey.md`](research/user-journey.md)  

### Competitive Analysis  
Compared with Swiggy, Zomato, and other cafeteria apps → identified gaps in queue handling.  
See [`research/competitive-analysis.md`](research/competitive-analysis.md)

## 🛠️ Design Process  

1. **Information Architecture** → See [`design/sitemap.png`](design/sitemap.png)  
2. **User Flows** → See [`design/userflow.png`](design/userflow.png)  
3. **Wireframes** → [`design/wireframes/`](design/wireframes/)  
4. **High-Fidelity Mockups** → [`design/mockups/`](design/mockups/)  
5. **Prototype (Figma)** → [Click Here](https://figma.com/your-prototype-link)

## ✅ Outcomes & Learnings  

- Reduced **waiting time stress** by providing virtual tokens  
- Improved **canteen staff efficiency**  
- Group ordering feature → improved social meal experience  
- Learned to balance **business needs (speed)** with **user needs (clarity & ease of use)**
